# lalabase

Lalabase from the terminal: one binary for a person with arrow keys (a
full-screen interface) and for scripts and Claude Code (plain text or JSON).

**Status:** foundation (slice C0). Nothing to use day to day yet.

## Build

```sh
go build ./cmd/lalabase
./lalabase version
```

Go version: see `go.mod`.

## Development

```sh
go vet ./...
go test -race ./...
golangci-lint run
go-licenses check ./cmd/... --allowed_licenses=MIT,Apache-2.0,BSD-2-Clause,BSD-3-Clause,ISC,0BSD
```

* **Foreign text** (titles, comments, names, server error texts) goes through
  `internal/clean` before it reaches the terminal, in every mode. Its test
  cases are those of `bin/lala` in the core repository, byte for byte, plus a
  test over every code point. The output is valid UTF-8 for a **UTF-8
  terminal**; an 8-bit terminal that reads C1 controls from single bytes cannot
  be protected by cleaning (ordinary letters carry such bytes once encoded), so
  the output layer refuses a locale that is not UTF-8.
* **No invisible characters in the repository:** `internal/sourceguard` reads
  every tracked text file. Write such characters as escapes or numbers.
* **The server contract** is a copy of `spec/fixtures/mcp_contract.json` of the
  core repository, with its origin in `internal/contract/testdata/SOURCE.json`.
  Refresh it when the client adopts a newer server:
  `go run ./tools/update-contract -core <path to the core checkout> -ref origin/main`.
* **Talking to the server** (`internal/transport`): REST readers under `/api/v1`
  and MCP tools under `/api/mcp`. Every answer gets one class (object, not
  found, no access, read-only, refused, invalid input, unauthenticated,
  protocol, temporary, canceled); the cache (`internal/cache`) and the
  interface decide from the class, never from the server's wording. An older
  server without the machine field is recognised only by its exact texts;
  anything else it says is a refusal. TLS is required except for localhost, a
  certificate that does not check out is a protocol error (never retried), and
  redirects are not followed. `Sent` says whether a request left the client, so
  a write with an unclear outcome is reloaded, not sent again.
* **Writes** need the idempotency key of the person's action (8 to 128
  letters, digits or `._:-`, a form the server keeps unchanged); an adapter
  refuses a write without one before sending. An answer to a write never
  replaces or drops the record: a refused write keeps it, a successful one
  keeps it and asks for a reload.
* **Adapters** (`internal/api`): one per tool and REST reader, each with a
  `Spec` naming the arguments it sends and the fields it needs back (present
  and not null; a field that may be null is marked `?`). The same
  spec drives feature detection (`internal/features`, from `tools/list` and the
  input schemas; the server version decides nothing), the runtime check of
  every answer, and the compatibility test against the contract copy.
* **Dependencies** must be permissive (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, ISC); CI checks it.

## Release

Push a tag `v*` (a version: `v` plus digits, letters, `.`, `+`, `-`). The
release workflow runs the whole CI on it first, then builds macOS (arm64,
amd64) and Linux (amd64, arm64) without write access, and only the last job
attaches the archives with `checksums.txt` to a GitHub release.
